## Summary

There are a few improvements on this analysis, for example with the data set and the pricing model described in the [webpage](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/pricing) we can have a good benchmark for our market research regarding average expenditure and potential revenues. Since NY is a big developed city this analysis should be extrapolated to small cities with more distances and usually with less adoption of this kind of model.
